				<h3>A new Career</h3>
				<p> Never in a million years thought I will get into this business, but I am thankful I did.
					Doing business is something I have always liked and learning a new business was something I was more excited about.
					Imagine youself, you are 20 and get told that you will travel 4 times a year for work. What would you do?
					You are not turning it down. NEVER .</p>
